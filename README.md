# US domestic airline flights performance

This notebook is the final exam for the Coursera-IBM "Data Visualization with Python" course. Here I built a script to analyze the performance of the US domestic airline flights to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability.

The key report items are:

- Yearly airline performance report (between 2005 and 2020)
- Yearly average flight delay statistics (between 2005 and 2020)
